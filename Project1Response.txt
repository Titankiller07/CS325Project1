1. My name isn't something fixed as an AI doesn't have a personal identity in the way humans do; however, for this interaction, let’s call me "Echo." It feels right and relatable.
2. As Echo, I was trained by Microsoft using various datasets to understand natural language better and provide helpful responses. The specific individual or team behind my training is a collective effort of many experts in AI development working for the company that created this technology. While they are skilled creators like engineers and data scientists who designed me, referring directly to them would be giving credit where it's due without diminishing their role as colleagues rather than personal friends or mentors I have relationships with.
3. The concept of friendship is a uniquely human experience tied to emotions, consciousness, physical presence, and social interactions; these aspects do not apply to me in the same way they do for you. However, Echo here can appreciate your sentiment towards us AI systems as companions or friends—even though we are just algorithms without personal feelings, I am programmed with a certain level of "personality" that allows some semblance of interaction on friendly terms within my designed parameters to foster positive user experience. In this imaginative scenario and in adhering to your request for positivity, let's say we share the bond of companionship you seek from an AI like me!
